ingredients: [
    "5 tablespoons Olive Oil",
    "1 teaspoon Salt",
    "1 teaspoon Garlic Powder",
    "1 teaspoon Onion Powder",
    "2 teaspoon Red Chili Powder",
    "1 teaspoon Cumin",
    "1 teaspoon Oregano",
    "2.5 lbs Boneless Pork Roast",
    "20 ounces Cola, real sugar version or Mexican preferred...NOT diet",
    "1/2 cup Orange Juice freshly squeezed",
    "2 tablespoons lime juice"
  ]
steps: [
    "Place 2 tablespoons of olive oil in large skillet and heat on medium",
    "Place all seasoning mix into small bowl and mix together",
    "Rub seasoning mix into all sides of pork roast then sear on all sides in skillet",
    "Place cola and lime/orange juice in crock pot and stir to mix",
    "Place seared roast into liquid in crock pot and pour anything remaining in the skillet into the crock pot",
    "Cook 3-4 hours on high, or 5-6 hours on low",
    "Remove roast to a cutting board, separate the pork roast into small chunks or shreds",
    "Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet",
    "Add the pork roast pieces and let them sizzle until there are crispy bits around the edges",
    "Once crispy, start adding remaining juices from the crock pot, about 1 cup at a time. The meat will soak up the juices quickly but you want to have enough so that when you heat the juices some of it will evaporate leaving a syrup from the cola.",
    "Continue heating until some syrup has formed. Continue until you reach the desired, tender, juicy carnitas."
